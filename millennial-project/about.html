		<p>With this project we wanted to better understand the Millennial generation and to parse the truth from among all the clutter on the internet from all different kinds of sources. Biased or otherwise. It quickly became clear that the perceived hostility of older generations to the newer generations is a pattern that has been repeated since time immemorial. Given the fast pace of technologies turnoever these days, however, it is entirely possible that the iGeneration won't apply to 20 years of births, but perhaps even half that before there's another dramatic shift, meaning that it would benefit humans to create social constructs for handling the changing of the guard, so to speak. Because at the same time as not all change is bad, it is not necessarily good as well - Millennials could have benefited by listening to their elders about spending too much time on the computer, just as Gen X and Baby Boomers could have learned much by incorporating more technology into their daily and work lives.</p> <br>
