		<h2 class="clearfix">About This Project</h2>
		
		<p>With this project we wanted to better understand the Millennial generation and to parse the truth from among all the clutter on the internet from all different kinds of sources. Biased or otherwise. It quickly became clear that the perceived hostility of older generations to the newer generations is a pattern that has been repeated since time immemorial. Given the fast pace of technologies turnoever these days, however, it is entirely possible that the iGeneration won't apply to 20 years of births, but perhaps even half that before there's another dramatic shift, meaning that it would benefit humans to create social constructs for handling the changing of the guard, so to speak. Because at the same time as not all change is bad, it is not necessarily good as well - Millennials could have benefited by listening to their elders about spending too much time on the computer, just as Gen X and Baby Boomers could have learned much by incorporating more technology into their daily and work lives.</p> <br>

		<h6 class="tabletfix">Ellen Najera-Hohlbein | Front End Developer, Content Writer</h6>
		
		<p>Ellen is a Senior at Washington State University in Vancouver, majoring in Digital Technology & Culture (DTC) with minors in English and Communications. Although she has many varied interests and skills, her primary 'superpower' (as they are called in the DTC program) is combining website design and development in one neat package. This aligns well with her strong interest in User Interface (UI) design and marketing, both of which rely on an intimate understanding of the human mind. Inspired by the work she has done for <a href="http://www.childnow.org/">CHILD</a> and volunteering with the <a href="http://southwesthumane.org/">Humane Society of Southwest Washington</a>, she would ultimately like to bring these skills to non-profits and organizations that otherwise might not be able to boast robust digital presences. An aesthetically pleasing website that is convenient to navigate (combined with social media presence of course) is a necessity in the modern world and can add credibility when present and detracts heavily if not.</p>
