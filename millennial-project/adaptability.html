		<p>Millennials are one of the most accepting generations to date. <span class="italic">Obergefell v. Hodges</span> is a landmark Supreme Court decision, that as of June 2015 requires all United States to issue marriage licenses to homosexual couples applying for them, in addition, states are now required to recognize homosexual marriages performed in other jurisdictions. Popular social media such as Tumblr blogs and the popularity of actress Laverne Cox (Sophia Burset on <span class="italic">Orange Is the New Black</span>) are demonstrating the effectiveness of the inclusionary upbringing Millennials had. Even though Millennials are often accused of being lazy and always on their devices, the generation has achieved some remarkable social campaigns such as the Ice Bucket Challenge to support the ALS Association. Millennials haven't stopped being active and campaigning for social justice - they just changed <span class="italic">how</span>.</p>
		
		<h5 id="marriage">Marriage Equality</h5>
		<span class="twocol"><p>As of 2015, Millennials corner the market on approval of same sex marriage at 70%, following closely are Gen X'ers at 59%, Baby Boomers and the Silent Generation are both beneath 40% <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2015/07/29/graphics-slideshow-changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/">(Pew Research Center)</a>. Although those numbers show that it wasn't Millennials alone that caused the marriage equality decision, they do clearly show the Millennials were spearheading the push.  Whether they were LGBT or Allies (as heterosexual advocates are referred to) the young people overwhelmed the old and successfully advocated for change.</p>
		
		<h5 id="acceptance">Acceptance of Diversity</h5>
		<p>"In fact guess what... you can be whoever you are and like whoever you like and WE should spread the love and acceptance we constantly say we donâ€™t receive," a quote from Ruby Rose (another star in <span class="italic">Orange Is the New Black</span>) who identifies as gender fluid. Although Ruby is referencing stereotyping and hate specifically within the LGBT community itself, the words ring true for the young generations of today in general as well. This sort of general inclusion is not limited to just the younger generations of America, every generation since the freeing of the slaves has participated in learning greater inclusion - however there was the 'don't ask, don't tell' philosophy whereas Millennials and Gen Y don't believe you must be silent and compliant to not suffer.</p>
		<p>A national poll of Millennials, sponsored by Fusion.com, asked only one question: do you believe gender is binary (male and female) or a spectrum. The results were fairly clear. A clear majority were in favor of gender as a spectrum, and the few dissenters were from the South (as they defined the South), 30-34 (the oldest age group), African American, self-reported conservatives, and those with only high school education <a href="https://fusiondotnet.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/fusion-poll-gender-spectrum.pdf">(Fusion)</a>.</p>
		
		<h5 id="campaigns">Digital Campaigns</h5>
		<p>Remember the <a href="http://www.alsa.org/fight-als/ice-bucket-challenge.html">ice bucket challenge</a>? It was to support the ALS Association for finding a cure to ALS, where people would literally dump a bucket of ice water over their head, donate to the cause, and tag others in social media. It worked for awareness and  raising money. They recorded donations upwards of $115 million and most importantly they made their spending wildly available and understandable - by way of infographic, a trendy new way to impart information in the digital era <a href="http://time.com/money/4000583/ice-bucket-challenge-money-donations/">(Wolff-Mann)</a>.</p> 
		<p>Arguably one of the largest social media campaigns is <a href="http://www.itgetsbetter.org/">It Gets Better</a>. Although harder to objectively analyze its success, the campaign is one of the most well known for having videos from all kinds of people, famous or not, trying to let LGBT youth know that the struggles they might face at the time will not always be so. This campaign came in direct response to the bullying, teasing, and hopelessness plaguing LGBT teens around the world as a resource for empathy and understanding.</p>
		<p>A companion project is <a href="https://wegotyourbackproject.wordpress.com/about/">The We Got Your Back Project</a> which addresses the hate and discrimination that actually happens internally in the LGBT world. This type of discrimination from a group of ones peers can be even more damaging, they argue, than from outside sources. </p></span>
