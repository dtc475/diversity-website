			<p>Internet use warnings, inclusion of tablets as education tools, teaching <a href="http://domain.me/10-social-networking-etiquette-rules-your-children-have-to-know/">social etiquette</a> online</p> 
			<p>Games like MC to learn coding and cooperation and other useful skills like how to do your chores before playing and more. "With more than 18 million downloads to date, Minecraft is the best-selling computer game of all time" <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/02/teaching-in-the-age-of-minecraft/385231/">(The Atlantic)</a>. "First played an early version of Minecraft with his 5-year-old daughter in 2010. He was amazed at how much his daughter was learning from Minecraft; she solved problems on her own, developed a spatial understanding in the game, and accelerated her reading and writing skills because she wanted to be able to interact with other players, he said" <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/02/teaching-in-the-age-of-minecraft/385231/">(The Atlantic)</a>. "'Are we going to treat our class’ Minecraft world as an extension of our classroom? Do the rules that apply in the school building also apply on our Minecraft server? What happens if someone breaks those rules?' These were lessons in what Levin calls digital citizenship, which were typically being taught in middle school, once students were already deeply embedded in social networks, but not yet in elementary school when they were just starting to use them and the lessons would be most useful" <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/02/teaching-in-the-age-of-minecraft/385231/">(The Atlantic)</a>. "video games can increase students’ spatial knowledge, improving their aptitude for math and science. And video games can help give students the hard skills they will need to function in a digital world, such as physical dexterity with keyboards and touch screens, an understanding of algorithms and search engines, and even basic programming" <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/02/teaching-in-the-age-of-minecraft/385231/">(The Atlantic)</a>.</p>
