		<p>Chances are you either are a Millennial, or know one. Whatâ€™s a Millennial, you say? You have come to the right place. This project was made by four people, admittedly all Millennials themselves, but not for the purpose of extolling virtues but rather to get a comprehensive look at our own generation as well as to understand where we came from and where we might go in the future. Even though generational cohorts are admittedly not always the most scientific, they can be useful tools to get an idea of radical attitude shifts in populations. However it is imperative to recall that even though generalizations may apply to a mass of people, they very rarely hold up completely when looking at an individual.</p>
		
		<p>That being said there are many ideas of just who make up generations, so using primarily Pew Research Center sources this page is dedicated to showing a baseline for the rest of our project.</p>
		
		<h5 class="hideme">Generational Cohorts</h5>
		<a href="http://www.people-press.org/2015/09/03/the-whys-and-hows-of-generations-research/" title="Follow ink to the information source at Pew Research."><img src="img/generations-01.png" alt="graph portraying information about the generations by birth year"></a>
		
		<p>Demonstrated above are the commonly accepted periods of time given to each generation, typically in 20 year increments, although not always. The Silent generation fought and saw the end of WWII experiencing high amounts of patriotism as well as "conformist and civic instincts"(<a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/02/24/millennials-confident-connected-open-to-change/">Pew Research Center</a>). A more rebellious generation followed, the Baby Boomers, so named for the increased period of fertility following the end of the war. Next came Gen X, which is often overlooked due to the larger size of the Baby Boomer and Millennial cohort (<a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/02/24/millennials-confident-connected-open-to-change/">Pew Research Center</a>). It is worth noting that very, very little information gathering has been done about the iGeneration - in fact most people cannot even agree on a name, often throwing around iGen, Gen Z, post-Millennials, among others. Millennials themselves have had the most attention in recent years, being the favorite target of marketing research and the like.</p>

		<h5 class="hideme">Generational Ethnicity</h5>

		<p>Despite being one of the highest educated generations, Millennials make about $3,472 less than Baby Boomers did at the same ages, largely due to the recession in 2008 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/opinion/sunday/were-making-life-too-hard-for-millennials.html?smid=tw-share&_r=1">(NY Times)</a>. Now that the definitions are out of the way, time to get to the analysis!</p>
