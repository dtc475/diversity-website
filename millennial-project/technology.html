		<h5>Physiological Effects</h5>
		<p>Technology has had quite an effect on the human brain.</p>
		
			<h6>Multitasking & Attention Span</h6>
			<p>"Serious media multitasking is beginning to be recognized as a neural addiction. Multitasking increases production of the hormones cortisol and adrenaline. Increased amounts of these hormones overstimulate the brain, causing fuzzy thinking. In addition, the prefrontal cortex prefers external stimulation and rewards reading every post, Internet search or message with a burst of endogenous opioids. Essentially, this feedback loop rewards the brain for losing focus" <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2989987/it-management/out-of-focus-the-multitasking-dilemma.html">(Computer World)</a>.</p> 
			<p>"Because the high multitaskers showed they couldn't ignore things" "the high multitaskers did a lousy job at remembering" "the heavy multitaskers underperformed the light multitaskers...[when] switching from one thing to another" <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/august24/multitask-research-study-082409.html">(Standford News)</a>.</p> 
			<p>Average attention span has been reduced to like 3 seconds and the most our brains can pay attention to is like 30 second sound clips.</p>
			
			<h6>How Millennials Remember Things has Changed</h6>
			<p>This is about how technology has encouraged brains to remember how to find information rather than the information itself based on a few studies. "Betsy Sparrow, an assistant professor of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/psychology_and_psychologists/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">psychology</a> at Columbia, wondered whether  people were more likely to remember information that could be easily retrieved from a computer, just as students are more likely to recall facts they believe will be on a test" <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/health/15memory.html">(New York Times)</a>.</p>
			
			
		<h5>Communication</h5>
			<h6>Fighting Insularity</h6>
			<p>We have a lot of <a href="http://www.lindseypollak.com/millennials-at-work-the-global-generation/">global students</a>, and we are more prone to viewing the world one big community as opposed to before with the tribal mentality of patriotism before everything else. Instantaneous communication has enabled this kind of international dialogue.</p>
			
			<h6>Social Media</h6>
			<p>I have no idea what we want to put here.</p>
			
		<h5>Technology has Uneven Dispersion</h5>
		<p>In which we talk about how not all Millennials have access to as much technology as they are stereotyped to have and even ones that do have devices and internet access use this access differently depending on their education and socioeconomic status.</p>
