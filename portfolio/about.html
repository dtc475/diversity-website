		<p><h3>About</h3></p><br />
		
		
		
		<p>I started out like most people do: snoring through third period french. I wandered for a while before a great personal loss drove me back into my education, where I re-discovered a passion that I'd always had; creation. In 2013 I was hired at a publishing magazine as a Fiction Editor. One thing led to another and six months into this job and I was smack dab in the middle of Rome, Italy.  </p><br />
		
		<p>I know, right. To be honest it came as kind of a surprise to me, as well. </p><br />
		
		<p>Two months, a shattered iPhone 4s (thank you St. Petersberg cobblestone streets), and blistered feet later I was back in the states. I was tired, sunburnt, happy to be able to do a simple load of laundry again, but that two months of hostels and overnight trains with tiny compartments taught me something: the sunrise waits for no-one. 	</p><br />
		
		<p>I was accepted into <a href="http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/">Washington State University: Vancouver</a> in early 2014, and began attending that fall, as a Digital Technology and Culture Major, in the <a href="http://www.dtc-wsuv.org/cmdc/">Creative Media and Digital Culture</a> department. My specialty (we call them superpowers, cause we're neat like that) swings between graphic design and web development, because I enjoy both. I'm also in the process of getting my Professional Writing certificate. </p><br />
